## notes
1. I spend around 10-15 hours coding this project
1. Since the requirements were "no libraries" and "native javascript" I figured
  You want to see my language and system skills. I decided to capitalize on
  that and create my own micro-framework for the front-end part of the project.
  Also, I was just enjoying myself... That's why so much time. ;)

## songs
As a proof of enjoying myself, here's a couple of songs I've been listinig
to during coding.
